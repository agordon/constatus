v2.0
 * since this version you can have multiple cameras per process
   This requires a small change in the configuration-file for existing setups. Please check constatus.cfg for an example, or:

	instances = ({
	   source = {
	   }

	   motion_trigger = {
	   }
	},

	/* ... */

	{
	   source = {
	   }

	   motion_trigger = {
	   }
	})

 * 2.0 requires sqlite3 although you can disable that by removing sqlite3 from Makefile and commenting out WITH_SQLITE3 in config.h
